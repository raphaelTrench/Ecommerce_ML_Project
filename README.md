# Ecommerce_ML_Project
This repository is a personal project I have decided to work on in order to grow more familiar with CNNs and working with image data.
For this project, instead of exploring some famous dataset online, I have also opted on building my own shoes dataset, through crawling an e-commerce website called netshoes. 
Then, for the next step, analyzing the data that I have generated, trying to extract some information.
Lastly, I experimented with applying AI to try and generate some more value from the data, creating different classification models to fit the data that was crawled, namely models for detecting shoes' brand and gender, and also to generate even more data by using an unsupervised learning technique to extract and images main colors.

Any sort of feedback is greatly appreciated!!!
